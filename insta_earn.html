  <h2>Benefits of Investing in Stock Market : </h2>

<h2 id="gains">Gains</h2>
<p>The most important aspect of investing directly in markets is the potential of the market to deliver the kind of gains it does.</p>
<p>Historic data suggests that stock markets have always passed the test of time, they have risen in value over a period of time, even though individual stock prices fluctuate on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Investing in companies that showcase a stable graph of growth and tend to clock higher profits every quarter or investing in sectors that add to the economic growth of the country will result in steadily building your wealth and increasing the value of your investment over a period of time.</p>
<h2 id="trading">Hassle-free trading</h2>
<p>Buying and selling stocks or stock trading is no longer a complex mechanism. With the Paytm Money app on your mobile phone, trading is just a click away.</p>
<p>You can regularly monitor your investment in stock markets and trade along with your full-time jobs as it’s no longer a long and tiring process.</p>
<h2 id="guard">Guard Against Inflation</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of investments is to secure our future, but we need to check in upon inflation from time to time.</p>
<p>If inflation and the rate of return on investments are similar then our gains become nil. The rate of return on investments should be ideally higher than inflation.</p>
<p>Stock markets or benchmark indices (Nifty and Sensex in the case of India) have always stayed ahead of inflation.</p>
<p>For instance, if inflation is around 3-4%, then markets have clocked in yearly gains of around 10%.</p>
<h2 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h2>
<p>Stocks are termed as liquid assets i.e. an asset that can be easily converted to cash, which has many buyers at any given point in time.</p>
<p>The same is not the case for all assets, it is difficult to find a buyer for some assets like property. It could take months to cash in on the investment made in the property. However, in the case of stocks, it is much easier.</p>
<p>The average daily volume of transactions on NSE and BSE is high, which means that there are multiple buyers and sellers for a single stock.</p>
<h2 id="advantage">Advantage of the Booming Economy</h2>
<p>The stock market is always a factor in the booming economy and reacts to all the economic growth indicators such as GDP, inflation, corporate earnings, and so on.</p>
<p>Stock market investors are the ones who can take direct advantage of a booming economy and the value of the investment grows in proportion to economic growth.</p>
<p>When an economy is on a path of growth, corporate earnings are boosted, as a result of which the average income of an individual increases.</p>
<p>This in turn affects consumer demand, leading to an uptick in sales. Hence, the value of your investment in a particular company increases i.e the share price increases.</p>
<h2 id="framework">A Well Regulated and Transparent Framework</h2>
<p>The Indian stock market is regulated by the Stock Exchange Board of India (SEBI). SEBI is responsible for regulating the stock exchanges, their development, and protecting the rights of the investors.</p>
<p>This means when investors invest in financial products on the stock market, their interests are well-protected by a regulatory framework laid down by SEBI, which helps in reducing risks of fraudulent activities by companies.</p>
<h2 id="flexible">Flexiblity To Invest in Smaller Amounts</h2>
<p>As a newbie investor, you can start with small investments in the market by buying small-cap or mid-cap stocks or buying large-cap stocks but in smaller units. Stocks do not demand a lump sum investment amount.</p>
<p>Another feature of directly investing in stocks is that you can buy at your own discretion there is no compulsion of investing a particular sum of amount every month.</p>
<h2 id="dividend">Dividend Benefits</h2>
<p>A dividend is an additional income for investors, which is paid annually by most companies.</p>
<p>Dividend payments arrive even if the stock has lost value and represents income on top of any profits that come from eventually selling the stock.</p>
<p>Dividend income can help fund a retirement or pay for even more investing as you grow your investment portfolio over time.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">An Ownership Stake in the Company</h2>
<p>Buying a stock essentially means that you are buying an ownership stake in that particular company. It will give you a sense of ownership in the company that you like.</p>
<p>It means that you as a shareholder play an important part in a company&#8217;s decisions, you have the power to vote in those decisions. There are several instances when shareholders have prevented company management from making unreasonable decisions that are detrimental to their interests.</p>
<p>The company’s annual report will be sent to you in order to know about the overall growth of the company.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion&quot;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You must actively look at investing in stock markets and diversifying your financial portfolio because with that you can stay ahead of inflation. Apart from that, you will have the freedom to choose which companies to invest in, and also it will serve as a much-needed liquidity cushion.</p>
